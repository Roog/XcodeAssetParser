# XcodeAssetParser
Nodejs that parses an Assets.xcassets folder and it's contents. Generates a HTML file with colors and images listed.

This might have issues, it works for me ;)

### How to
Just put a Assets.xcassets in the same folder as the xcassets-parser.js and run

```sudo node xcassets-parser.js```
